### About

This is my **first frontend project**, a clone of Amazon’s landing page.  
It demonstrates basic **HTML structure, CSS styling, and layout design** with multiple sections such as navbar, search bar, product categories, and footer.  

The focus was on **learning core frontend concepts**, designing visually similar sections to Amazon, and understanding layout and positioning.

- Multiple **product category boxes** with images and titles
- Functional search bar (visual only, no live API)

- Styled footer with multiple panels and links
- Clean, readable **HTML & CSS** structure

### Notes

- This is **my first project**, so responsiveness is minimal.  
- Focus was on **layout, structure, and design replication** rather than full functionality.  
- Images and content are **kept as-is** to replicate the Amazon look.  
- Great starting point for improving **responsive skills** in future projects.
